how do i use apollo graphql client with aws appsync dynamodb and with external graphql endpoint

To use Apollo Client with AWS AppSync and DynamoDB, you will need to do the following:

Set up an AWS AppSync API and configure it to use DynamoDB as the data source.

Install the Apollo Client library in your project by running npm install apollo-client or yarn add apollo-client (assuming you are using npm or yarn as your package manager).

Create an Apollo Client instance and configure it to connect to your AppSync API by providing the GraphQL endpoint and any required authentication headers.

Here is an example of how you might do this:


```
import ApolloClient from "apollo-client";
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "https://your-appsync-endpoint.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "your-api-key"
  }
});
```
To use Apollo Client with an external GraphQL endpoint, you can follow a similar process. Just replace the URI and any authentication headers with the appropriate values for your endpoint.

Once you have an Apollo Client instance configured to connect to your GraphQL API, you can use it to send queries and mutations just like you would with any other GraphQL API.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Understood. However, I need to connect to both appsync and external graphql in the same application

To connect to both AWS AppSync and an external GraphQL endpoint in the same application, you can create two separate Apollo Client instances and use them independently.

Here is an example of how you might do this:


```
import ApolloClient from "apollo-client";

const appSyncClient = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "https://your-appsync-endpoint.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "your-api-key"
  }
});

const externalClient = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "https://your-external-endpoint.com/graphql"
});
```

You can then use the appSyncClient to send GraphQL queries and mutations to your AWS AppSync API, and the externalClient to send queries and mutations to the external GraphQL endpoint.

For example:


```
appSyncClient.query({
  query: YOUR_QUERY
});

externalClient.mutation({
  mutation: YOUR_MUTATION
});

```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

how do i use both clients with apolloProvider?

To use both the AWS AppSync client and the external client with ApolloProvider, you can create a new Apollo Client instance that combines both of them using the ApolloLink.split function.

Here is an example of how you might do this:

```
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloLink } from "apollo-client";
import { HttpLink } from "apollo-link-http";
import { onError } from "apollo-link-error";
import { setContext } from "apollo-link-context";

const appSyncLink = new HttpLink({
  uri: "https://your-appsync-endpoint.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "your-api-key"
  }
});

const externalLink = new HttpLink({
  uri: "https://your-external-endpoint.com/graphql"
});

const errorLink = onError(({ graphQLErrors, networkError }) => {
  if (graphQLErrors) {
    // handle GraphQL errors
  }
  if (networkError) {
    // handle network errors
  }
});

const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
  // get the authentication token from local storage if it exists
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  // return the headers to the context so httpLink can read them
  return {
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : ""
    }
  };
});

const link = ApolloLink.split(
  operation => operation.getContext().clientName === "external",
  externalLink,
  ApolloLink.from([errorLink, authLink, appSyncLink])
);

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link,
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

// wrap your app with ApolloProvider and pass the client as a prop
<ApolloProvider client={client}>
  <App />
</ApolloProvider>
```

This creates a new Apollo Client that uses the appSyncLink for operations that don't specify a clientName, and the externalLink for operations that specify a clientName of "external".

To specify the clientName for an operation, you can use the context option when sending a query or mutation. For example:

```
client.query({
  query: YOUR_QUERY,
  context: {
    clientName: "external"
  }
});
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

I did not know about apollolink.split. looks like this should work.

I'm glad to hear that! ApolloLink.split is a useful function for creating an Apollo Client that can send operations to multiple backends. It allows you to specify a condition for deciding which backend to use for a given operation, and then forwards the operation to the appropriate backend based on that condition.

I hope this helps you set up your application to connect to both AWS AppSync and an external GraphQL endpoint. If you have any further questions or run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask. Good luck with your project!
